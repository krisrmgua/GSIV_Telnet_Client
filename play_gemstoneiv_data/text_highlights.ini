The entry foyer to this enormous granite crypt is stark, adorned only with grisly friezes sculpted in low relief into the walls.  Bands of bluish-green ahnver are inlaid into the stone in thin strips just below the ceiling throughout the entire structure, bathing the rooms in a subtle light.  A shadowy arch curves overhead and leads deeper into the inner sanctum of the sepulcher.  You also see a cracked urn and an open black marble ossuary.||{purple}The entry foyer to this enormous granite crypt is stark, adorned only with grisly friezes sculpted in low relief into the walls.

This is the heart of the main square of Wehnimer's Landing.  The impromptu shops of the bazaar are clustered around this central gathering place, where townsfolk, travellers, and adventurers meet to talk, conspire or raise expeditions to the far-flung reaches of Elanith.  At the north end of the space, an old well, with moss-covered stones and a craggy roof, is shaded by a strong, robust tree.  The oak is tall and straight, and it is apparent that the roots run deep.||{purple}This is the heart of the main square of Wehnimer's Landing.

The ground is dark and springy, the damp peat concealing the high water table beneath.  Ominous vapors and swamp gases born of rotting vegetation and corpses bubble up through the muck.  Moving in lazy eddies just above the ruined gravesites, the fumes cause you to choke and gag.||{purple}The ground is dark and springy, the damp peat concealing the high water table beneath.

This little pawnshop is somewhat cheerier than you would expect, presided over by its well-dressed and well-heeled owner, Kilron.  A polished white marble counter is set off by freshly whitewashed walls and a highly varnished wood floor.  An antique cabinet on the far wall holds several impressive and equally ancient weapons, some precious trinkets, and several items that you cannot identify, except that they seem to glow in different shades of colored light with different intensities.||{purple}This little pawnshop is somewhat cheerier than you would expect, presided over by its well-dressed and well-heeled owner, Kilron.

A massive bronze gate spans the path, blocking the way north.  On either side are high stone walls surmounted with jagged rocks.  Now green and pitted, the gate is still locked shut by a rusted chain fastened with an ancient padlock.  A cast likeness of the goddess Lorminstra, Keeper of the Gates of Oblivion, her Staff of Doom in hand, and a grotesque statue of the Empress Gosaena are the main motifs of the elaborately decorated portal.||{purple}A massive bronze gate spans the path, blocking the way north.

The bustling town comes together in this square.  Halflings dressed in varying fashions stand about, some chattering happily, others reclining on cloaks laid on the ground.  One ancient halfling leans against the base of the large ice statue of a mule, snoring blissfully.  A feeling of community pervades the area, putting you immediately at ease.||{purple}The bustling town comes together in this square.

A small oil lamp provides a bright light as it reflects from the walls.  Your arrival was anticipated, as someone has placed your locker on top of the counter for you.  You also see a curtained opening.||{purple}A small oil lamp provides a bright light as it reflects from the walls.

A well maintained and healthy garden occupies the entirety of the courtyard.  The air here is cool and crisp, though the sun's strong rays beat back any feelings of cold.  In the center of the garden is a natural spring bubbling up several inches above the surface of the encircling pool of crystal clear water.||{purple}A well maintained and healthy garden occupies the entirety of the courtyard.

Blackened from a previous mishap with fire, the wooden table in one corner of the room has a rickety bench tucked beneath it.  Lining the back wall of this spacious room, sturdy oak planks serve as bookshelves housing over a dozen thick, leather-bound tomes.||{purple}Blackened from a previous mishap with fire, the wooden table in one corner of the room has a rickety bench tucked beneath it.

The remains here consist of the dead bodies of a few small burrowing creatures and little else of apparent value.  Broken chests, torn hogsheads and gunny sacks, stiff goatskins filled with sour ale, some worm-eaten leatherbound books, and other everyday items that have long outlived their usefulness have been left behind here to rot.||{purple}The remains here consist of the dead bodies of a few small burrowing creatures and little else of apparent value.

Lavish can not even begin to describe this room.  There are gold and jeweled objects everywhere.  Thick fur carpets the floor covering every inch of the rock.  Elaborate pillows are thrown about the room to be used for relaxing||{purple}Lavish can not even begin to describe this room.  There are gold and jeweled objects everywhere.

The serving maid stops in at each of the tables to check on her customers, and she nods a greeting in your direction.  The conversation is louder here, and someone's cigar adds to the smoky haze that fills one side of the room.||{purple}The serving maid stops in at each of the tables to check on her customers, and she nods a greeting in your direction.

The backroom of the locksmith's shop is stark, and lit by a single tallow candle.  A blob of wax secures the candle atop a locked case that provides the only seating in the uncomfortable room.  A tall cabinet secured with a sturdy padlock occupies the far wall.||{purple}The backroom of the locksmith's shop is stark, and lit by a single tallow candle.
